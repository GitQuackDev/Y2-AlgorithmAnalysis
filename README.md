# Comparative Analysis of Sorting Algorithms on Varying Data Distributions

## Project Objective
To implement and analyze the performance of sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort) on different types of data distributions and identify their time complexities in practice.


## Technical Requirements
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Data Sizes**: 1K, 10K, 100K elements
- **Data Types**: Random, Sorted, Reversed, Nearly Sorted
- **Algorithms**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort

## Getting Started
1. python -m venv venv
2. .\venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the analysis: `python main.py`
5. View results in the `results/` directory

## Expected Outputs
- Algorithm implementations
- Performance graphs
- Written analysis report
- Video presentation materials
